- try out log TFP
- solve tex-table riddle for covariate balance (emilie)


SECTION 3
----------
- Figure 1 & Figure 2
Overlap with and without TECH (for NN1 basic model)
--> show why TECH is crap (Table in Appendix) 
(Nelly)

- table 1 - basic model
1. NN1 basic (without TECH for TFP and Wages)
(Thea)

- table 2
2. NN5+caliper TFP
3: IPW
4. AIPW 
--> ATE, ATT
(Thea)

SECTION 4
----------
- table 3 (if doesnt work in one table, put in two)
-TFP by type of FDI (w/o TECH)
   --> multinom. probit/logit
   --> ipw and aipw
 (Georg)

-show lack of robustness for tech subsampling
